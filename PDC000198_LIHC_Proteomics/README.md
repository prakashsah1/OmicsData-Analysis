This repository contains analyses of proteomics data for Liver Hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC).

- Proteomics data for LIHC was downloaded from NCI proteomics data commons (PDC), PDC Study ID: PDC000198, study by Gao et al 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.08.052).
- Analysis was aimed at recreating Figure 3.
- Figure 3A: Heatmap of consensus clustering of 1,274 proteins differentially expressed between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue  (SAM, FDR q < 0.05, fold change > 1.5). Rows = proteins; columns = tumors. Z-score scaled log2 relative abundances.  Samples grouped into three proteomic subgroups: S-Mb (metabolic),  S-Pf (proliferative), and S-Me (microenvironment dysregulated).
- Figure 3B: Kaplan–Meier overall survival curves comparing the three proteomic subgroups. Note: The notes in the excel file downlaoded from NCI-PDC mentions that clinical data for 9 patients were lost and not available.
