# Omics Data Analysis

This repository contains exploratory analyses of publicly available omics datasets.

## Projects

- **TCGA-LIHC RNA-seq Analysis**: Differential expression analysis of Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) samples using DESeq2. Includes PCA, volcano plot, heatmap, and GO enrichment using clusterProfiler.
- **CPTAC LIHC proteome Analysis**: coming soon!
More projects will be added over time. Raw data files (e.g., FASTQ, BAM, STAR counts) are excluded to keep the repository lightweight.

Analyses are documented using R Markdown and rendered to PDF or HTML.
